<p class='c'>TO THE READER</p>

<p>What this book contains was
learned by the writer in the
course of two visits with Mr. Higgins
in the Minnesota woods&#8211;one in the
lumber-camps and lumber-towns at
midwinter, and again at the time
of the drive. Upon both occasions
Mr. Higgins was accompanied by his
devoted and admirable friend, the
Rev. Thomas D. Whittles, to whose
suggestions and leading he responded
with many a tale of his experiences,
some of which are here related. Mr.
Whittles was at the same time good
enough to permit the writer to draw
whatever information might seem
necessary from a more extended
description of Mr. Higgins&#8217;s work,
called <i>The Lumber-jack&#8217;s Sky Pilot</i>,
which he had written.</p>

<hr class='pb' />

<h1>HIGGINS<br />A MAN&#8217;S CHRISTIAN</h1>

<hr class='pb' />

<p class='c fs14'>HIGGINS<br />A MAN&#8217;S CHRISTIAN</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>I<br /><span class='h2fs'>HELL BENT</span></h2>

<p>Twenty thousand of the thirty
thousand lumber-jacks and river-pigs
of the Minnesota woods are
hilariously in pursuit of their own
ruin for lack of something better to
do in town. They are not nice, enlightened
men, of course; the debauch
is the traditional diversion&#8211;the theme
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
of all the brave tales to which the
youngsters of the bunk-houses listen
in the lantern-light and dwell upon
after dark. The lumber-jacks proceed
thus&#8211;being fellows of big
strength in every physical way&#8211;to
the uttermost of filth and savagery
and fellowship with every abomination.
It is done with shouting and
laughter and that large good-humor
which is bedfellow with the bloodiest
brawling, and it has for a bit, no
doubt, its amiable aspect; but the
merry shouters are presently become
like Jimmie the Beast, that low, notorious
brute, who, emerging drunk
and hungry from a Deer River saloon,
robbed a bulldog of his bone and
gnawed it himself&#8211;or like Damned
Soul Jenkins, who goes moaning into
the forest, after the spree in town,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
conceiving himself condemned to roast
forever in hell, without hope, nor even
the ease which his mother&#8217;s prayers
might win from a compassionate
God.</p>

<p>They can&#8217;t help themselves, it
seems. Not all of them, of course;
but most.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span><a id='link_2'></a>II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE PILOT OF SOULS</span></h2>

<p>A big, clean, rosy-cheeked man in
a Mackinaw coat and rubber
boots&#8211;hardly distinguishable from
the lumber-jack crew except for his
quick step and high glance and fine
resolute way&#8211;went swiftly through
a Deer River saloon toward the snake-room
in search of a lad from Toronto
who had in the camps besought to be
preserved from the vicissitudes of the
town.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the Pilot,&#8221; said a lumber-jack
at the bar. &#8220;Hello, Pilot!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>&#8220;&#8217;Lo, Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t ye goin&#8217; t&#8217; preach no more
at Camp Six?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;when the hell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Week from Thursday, Tom,&#8221; the
vanishing man called back; &#8220;tell the
boys I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know the Pilot?&#8221; the lumber-jack
asked.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Higgins&#8217;s job,&#8221; said he, earnestly,
&#8220;is keepin&#8217; us boys out o&#8217;
hell; an&#8217; he&#8217;s the only man on the
job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of this I had been informed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want t&#8217; tell ye, friend,&#8221; the
lumber-jack added, with honest reverence,
&#8220;that he&#8217;s a damned good
Christian, if ever there was one.
Ain&#8217;t that right, Billy?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>&#8220;Higgins,&#8221; the bartender agreed,
&#8220;is a square man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lumber-jack reverted to the
previous interest. All at once he
forgot about the Pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Billy!&#8221; he cried, severely,
&#8220;where&#8217;d ye put that bottle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins was then in the snake-room
of the place&#8211;a foul compartment
into which the stupefied and
delirious are thrown when they are
penniless&#8211;searching the pockets of
the drunken boy from Toronto for
some leavings of his wages. &#8220;Not
a cent!&#8221; said he, bitterly. &#8220;They
haven&#8217;t left him a cent! They&#8217;ve got
every penny of three months&#8217; wages!
Don&#8217;t blame the boy,&#8221; he pursued, in
pain and infinite sympathy, easing the
lad&#8217;s head on the floor; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t all
his fault. He came out of the camps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
without telling me&#8211;and some cursed
tin-horn gambler met him, I suppose&#8211;and
he&#8217;s only a boy&#8211;and they
didn&#8217;t give him a show&#8211;and, oh, the
pity of it! he&#8217;s been here only two
days!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was in a stupor of intoxication,
but presently revived a
little, and turned very sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;That you, Pilot?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Jimmie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A&#8217; right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel a bit better now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh-huh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy sighed and collapsed unconscious:
Higgins remained in the
weltering filth of the room to ease and
care for him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t wait for me,
old man,&#8221; said he, looking up from
the task. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be busy for a while.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span><a id='link_3'></a>III<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN THE SNAKE-ROOM</span></h2>

<p>Frank necessity invented the
snake-room of the lumber-town
saloon. There are times of gigantic
debauchery&#8211;the seasons of paying
off. A logger then once counted one
hundred and fifty men drunk in a
single hotel of a town of twelve hundred
inhabitants where fourteen other
bar-rooms heartily flourished. They
overflowed the snake-rooms&#8211;they lay
snoring on the bar-room floor&#8211;they
littered the office&#8211;they were doubled
up on the stair-landings and stretched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
out in the corridors. Drunken men
stumbled over drunken men and fell
helpless beside them; and still, in
the bar-room (said he)&#8211;beyond the
men who slept or writhed on the
floor and had been kicked out of the
way&#8211;the lumber-jacks were clamoring
three deep for whiskey at the
bar. Hence the snake-room: one
may not eject drunken men into bitter
weather and leave them to freeze.
Bartenders and their helpers carry
them off to the snake-room when
they drop; others stagger in of their
own notion and fall upon their reeking
fellows. There is no arrangement
of the bodies&#8211;but a squirming
heap of them, from which legs and
arms protrude, wherein open-mouthed
bearded faces appear in a tangle of
contorted limbs. Men moan and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
laugh and sob and snore; and some
cough with early pneumonia, some
curse, some sing, some horribly grunt;
and some, delirious, pick at spiders
in the air, and talk to monkeys, and
scream out to be saved from dogs
and snakes. Men reel in yelling
groups from the bar to watch the
spectacle of which they will themselves
presently be a part.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span><a id='link_4'></a>IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CLOTH IN QUEER PLACES</span></h2>

<p>This is the simple and veracious
narrative of the singular ministerial
activities of the Rev. Francis
Edmund Higgins, a Presbyterian,
who regularly ministers, without a
church, acting under the Board of
Home Missions, to the lumber-jacks
of the remoter Minnesota woods.
Singular ministerial activities these
are, truly, appealing alike to those
who believe in God and to such as
may deny Him. They are particularly
robust. When we walked from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
Camp Two to Camp Four of a midwinter
day, with the snow crackling
underfoot and the last sunset light
glowing like heavenly fire beyond the
great green pines&#8211;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Higgins, gravely,
&#8220;there&#8217;s just one thing that I regret;
and if I had to prepare for the ministry
over again, I wouldn&#8217;t make the
same mistake: I ought to have taken
boxing lessons.&#8221;</p>

<p>No other minister of the gospel,
possibly, could with perfect propriety,
in the sight of the unrighteous,
who are the most severe critics of
propriety in this respect, lean easily
over a bar (his right foot having of
long habit found the rail), and in
terms of soundest common sense
reasonably urge upon the man behind
the wet mahogany the shame of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
his situation and the virtue of abandoning
it; nor could any other whom
I know truculently crowd into the
howling, brawling, drunken throng of
lumber-jacks, all gone mad of adulterated
liquor, and with any confident
show of authority command the departure
of some weakling who had
followed the debauch of his mates
far beyond his little strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out o&#8217; this!&#8221; says Higgins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, go chase yerself, Pilot!&#8221; is
the indulgent response, most amiably
delivered, with a loose, kind smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; says Higgins, in wrath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Pilot,&#8221; the youngster pleads,
&#8220;I&#8217;m on&#8217;y havin&#8217; a little fun. You
go chase yerself, Pilot,&#8221; says he, affectionately,
with no offence whatsoever,
&#8220;an&#8217; le&#8217; me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Rev. Francis Edmund
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
Higgins, in the midst of an unholy up-roar&#8211;the
visible manifestation, this
environment and behavior, it seems
to me, of the noise and smell and very
abandonment of hell&#8211;is privileged
to seize the youngster by the throat
and in no unnecessarily gentle way
to jerk him into the clean, frosty air
of the winter night. In these days
of his ministry, nobody&#8211;the situation
being an ordinary one&#8211;would interfere.
If, however, it seemed unwise to
proceed in this way, Higgins would
at least strip the boy of his savings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand over!&#8221; says he.</p>

<p>The boy hands over every cent he
possesses. If Higgins suspects, he
will turn out the pockets. And later&#8211;late
in the night&#8211;with the wintry
dawn breaking, it may be&#8211;the sleepless
Pilot carries the boy off on his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
back to such saving care as he may
be able to exercise. To a gentle care&#8211;a
soft, tender solicitude, all separate
from the wild doings of the bar-room,
and all under cover, even as between
the boy and the Pilot. I have been
secretly told that the good Pilot is at
such times like a brooding mother
to the lusty, wayward youngsters of
the camps, who, in their prodigality,
do but manfully emulate the most
manly behavior of which they are
aware.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>To confuse Higgins with cranks
and freaks would be most injuriously
to wrong him. He is not an
eccentric; his hair is cropped, his
finger nails are clean, there is a commanding
achievement behind him,
he has manners, a mind variously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
interested, as the polite world demands.
Nor is he a fanatic; he would spit cant
from his mouth in disgust if ever it
chanced within. He is a reasonable
and highly efficient worker&#8211;a man
dealing with active problems in an
intelligent and thoroughly practical
way; and he is as self-respecting and
respected in his peculiar field as any
pulpit parson of the cities&#8211;and as sane
as an engineer. He is a big, jovial,
rotund, rosy-cheeked Irish-Canadian
(pugnacious upon occasion), with a
boy&#8217;s smile and eyes and laugh, with
a hearty voice and way, with a head
held high, with a man&#8217;s clean, confident
soul gazing frankly from unwavering
eyes: five foot nine and two
hundred pounds to him (which allows
for a little rippling fat). He is big
of body and heart and faith and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
outlook and charity and inspiration and
belief in the work of his hands; and
his life is lived joyously&#8211;notwithstanding
the dirty work of it&#8211;though
deprived of the common delights of
life. He has no church: he straps a
pack on his back and tramps the
logging-roads from camp to camp,
whatever the weather&#8211;twelve miles
in a blizzard at forty below&#8211;and
preaches every day&#8211;and twice and
three times a day&#8211;in the bunk-houses;
and he buries the boys&#8211;and marries
them to the kind of women they
know&#8211;and scolds and beseeches and
thrashes them, and banks for them.</p>

<p>God knows what they would do
without Higgins! He is as necessary
to them now&#8211;as much sought in
trouble and as heartily regarded&#8211;as
a Presbyterian minister of the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
school; he is as close and helpful and
dogmatic in intimate affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilot,&#8221; said Ol&#8217; Man Johnson,
&#8220;take this here stuff away from me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Sky Pilot rose astounded. Ol&#8217;
Man Johnson, in the beginnings of his
spree in town&#8211;half a dozen potations&#8211;was
frantically emptying his pockets
of gold (some hundreds of dollars) on
the preacher&#8217;s bed in the room above
the saloon; and he blubbered like a
baby while he threw the coins from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it away from me!&#8221; Ol&#8217; Man
Johnson wept, drawing back from the
money with a gesture of terror. &#8220;For
Christ&#8217;s sake, Pilot!<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>keep it away
from me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Pilot understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Ol&#8217; Man
Johnson, &#8220;it&#8217;ll kill me!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>Higgins sent a draft for the money
to Ol&#8217; Man Johnson when Ol&#8217; Man
Johnson got safely home to his wife
in Wisconsin. Another spree in town
would surely have killed Ol&#8217; Man
Johnson.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span><a id='link_5'></a>V<br /><span class='h2fs'>JACK IN CAMP</span></h2>

<p>The lumber-jack in camp can, in
his walk and conversation, easily
be distinguished from the angels;
but at least he is industrious and no
wild brawler. He is up and heartily
breakfasted and off to the woods,
with a saw or an axe, at break of day;
and when he returns in the frosty
dusk he is worn out with a man&#8217;s
labor, and presently ready to turn in
for sound sleep. They are all in the
pink of condition then&#8211;big and
healthy and clear-eyed, and wholly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
able for the day&#8217;s work. A stout,
hearty, kindly, generous crew, of
almost every race under the sun&#8211;in
behavior like a pack of boys. It is
the Saturday in town&#8211;and the occasional
spree&#8211;and the final debauch
(which is all the town will
give them for their money) that
litters the bar-room floor with the
wrecks of these masterful bodies.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Walking in from Deer River of a
still, cold afternoon&#8211;with the sun
low and the frost crackling under
foot and all round about&#8211;we encountered
a strapping young fellow
bound out to town afoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, boy!&#8221; said Higgins;
&#8220;where <i>you</i> going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deer River, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>There was some reply to this. It
was a childish evasion; the boy had
no honest business out of camp, with
the weather good and the work pressing,
and he knew that Higgins understood.
Meanwhile, he kicked at the
snow, with a sheepish grin, and would
not look the Pilot in the eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re from Three, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>thought</i> I saw you there in the
fall,&#8221; said the Pilot. &#8220;Well, boy,&#8221;
he continued, putting a strong hand
on the other&#8217;s shoulder, &#8220;look me in
the eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;God help you!&#8221; said the Pilot,
from his heart; &#8220;nobody else &#8217;ll give
you a show in Deer River.&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked on, Higgins in advance,
downcast. I turned, presently, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
discovered that the young lumber-jack
was running.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t get there fast enough,&#8221; said
Higgins. &#8220;I saw that his tongue was
hanging out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He seeks his pleasure,&#8221; I observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; Higgins replied; &#8220;and
the only pleasure the men of Deer
River will let him have is what he&#8217;ll
buy and pay for over a bar, until his
last red cent is gone. It isn&#8217;t right,
I tell you,&#8221; he exploded; &#8220;the boy
hasn&#8217;t a show, and it isn&#8217;t right!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was twelve miles from Camp
Three to Deer River. We met other
men on the road to town&#8211;men with
wages in their pockets, trudging
blithely toward the lights and liquor
and drunken hilarity of the place.
It was Saturday; and on Monday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
ejected from the saloons, they would
inevitably stagger back to the camps.
I have heard of one kindly logger
who dispatches a team to the nearest
town every Monday morning to gather
up his stupefied lumber-jacks from
the bar-room floors and snake-rooms
and haul them into the woods.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span><a id='link_6'></a>VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>&#8220;TO THE TALL TIMBER!&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>It is &#8220;back to the tall timber&#8221; for
the penniless lumber-jack. Perhaps
the familiar slang is derived from the
necessity. I recall an intelligent Cornishman&#8211;a
cook with a kitchen kept
sweet and clean&#8211;who with a laugh
contemplated the catastrophe of the
snake-room, and the nervous collapse,
and the bedraggled return to the
woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that&#8217;s
where I&#8217;ll land in the spring!&#8221;</p>

<p>It amazed me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; said he. &#8220;That&#8217;s
where my stake &#8217;ll go. Jake Boore &#8217;ll
get the most of it; and among the
lot of them they&#8217;ll get every cent.
I&#8217;ll blow four hundred dollars in
two weeks&#8211;if I&#8217;m lucky enough to
make it go that far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you know that they rob you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly they will rob me; everybody
knows <i>that</i>! But every year for
nine years, now, I&#8217;ve tried to get out
of the woods with my stake, and
haven&#8217;t done it. I intend to this year;
but I know I won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll strike for
Deer River when I get my money;
and I&#8217;ll have a drink at Jake Boore&#8217;s
saloon, and when I get that drink down
I&#8217;ll be on my way. It isn&#8217;t because
I want to; it&#8217;s because I have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t let you do anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
else,&#8221; said the cook. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried it
for nine years. Every winter I&#8217;ve
said to myself that I&#8217;ll get out of the
woods in the spring, and every spring
I&#8217;ve been kicked out of a saloon dead
broke. It&#8217;s always been back to the
tall timber for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you need, Jones,&#8221; said Higgins,
who stood by, &#8220;is the grace of
God in your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jones laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear me, Jones?&#8221; the Pilot
repeated. &#8220;What you need is the
grace of God in your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Pilot&#8217;s mad,&#8221; the cook laughed,
but not unkindly. &#8220;The Pilot
and I don&#8217;t agree about religion,&#8221; he
explained; &#8220;and now he&#8217;s mad because
I won&#8217;t go to church.&#8221;</p>

<p>This banter did not disturb the
Pilot in the least.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mad, Jones,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;All I&#8217;m saying,&#8221; he repeated, earnestly,
fetching the cook&#8217;s flour-board a
thwack with his fist, &#8220;is that what you
need is the grace of God in your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Jones laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Jones!&#8221; cried the
indignant preacher. &#8220;But I tell you
that what you need is the grace of
God in your heart. <i>And you know
it!</i> And when I get you in the snake-room
of Jake Boore&#8217;s saloon in Deer
River next spring,&#8221; he continued, in
righteous anger, &#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll rub it into you!</i>
Understand me, Jones? When I
haul you out of the snake-room, and
wash you, and get you sobered up,
I&#8217;ll rub it into you that what you need
is the grace of God in your heart to
give you the first splinter of a man&#8217;s
backbone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be humble&#8211;then,&#8221; said Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be a good deal
more than humble, friend,&#8221; Higgins
retorted, &#8220;before there&#8217;ll be a man
in the skin that <i>you</i> wear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it, Pilot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; the preacher sniffed, in fine
scorn.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>The story fortunately has an outcome.
I doubt that the cook took
the Pilot&#8217;s prescription; but, at any
rate, he had wisdom sufficient to warn
the Pilot when his time was out, and
his money was in his pocket, and he
was bound out of the woods in another
attempt to get through Deer
River. It was midwinter when
the Pilot prescribed the grace of
God; it was late in the spring when
the cook secretly warned him to stand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
by the forlorn essay; and it was later
still&#8211;the drive was on&#8211;when, one
night, as we watched the sluicing, I
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jones?&#8221; the Pilot replied, puzzled.
&#8220;What Jones?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cook who couldn&#8217;t get
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the Pilot, &#8220;you mean
Jonesy. Well,&#8221; he added, with satisfaction,
&#8220;Jonesy got through this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I asked for the tale of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d hardly believe it,&#8221; said the
Pilot, &#8220;but we cashed that big check
right in Jake Boore&#8217;s saloon. I
wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way, and
neither would Jonesy. In we went,
boys, brave as lions; and when Jake
Boore passed over the money Jonesy
put it in his pocket. Drink? Not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
he! Not a drop would he take. They
tried all the tricks they knew, but
Jonesy wouldn&#8217;t fall to them. They
even put liquor under his nose; and
Jonesy let it stay there, and just
laughed. I tell you boys, it was fine!
It was <i>great</i>! Jonesy and I stuck it
out night and day together for two
days; and then I put Jonesy aboard
train, and Jonesy swore he&#8217;d never
set foot in Deer River again. He was
going South, somewhere, to see&#8211;somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was doubtless the grace of God,
after all, that got the cook through:
if not the grace of God in the cook&#8217;s
heart, then in the Pilot&#8217;s.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span><a id='link_7'></a>VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>ROBBING THE BLIND</span></h2>

<p>It it a perfectly simple situation.
There are thirty thousand men-more
or less of them, according to the
season&#8211;making the wages of men in
the woods. Most of them accumulate
a hot desire to wring some enjoyment
from life in return for the labor they
do. They have no care about money
when they have it. They fling it in
gold over the bars (and any sober
man may rob their very pockets);
they waste in a night what they earn
in a winter&#8211;and then crawl back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
the woods. Naturally the lumber-towns
are crowded with parasites
upon their lusts and prodigality&#8211;with
gamblers and saloon-keepers
and purveyors of low passion. Some
larger capitalists, more acute and
more acquisitive, of a greed less nice
-profess the three occupations at
once. They are the men of real
power in the remoter communities,
makers of mayors and chiefs of police
and magistrates&#8211;or were until Higgins
came along to dispute them.
And their operations have been simple
and enormously profitable&#8211;so easy, so
free from any fear of the law, that I
should think they would (in their own
phrase) be ashamed to take the money.
It seems to be no trouble at all to abstract
a drunken lumber-jack&#8217;s wages.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>It takes a big man to oppose these
forces&#8211;a big heart and a big body,
and a store of hope and courage not
easily depleted. It takes, too, a good
minister; it takes a loving heart and
a fist quick to find the point of the
jaw to preach the gospel after the
manner of Higgins. And Higgins
conceives it to be one of his sacred
ministerial duties to protect his parishioners
in town. Behind the bunk-houses,
in the twilight, they say to
him: &#8220;When you goin&#8217; t&#8217; be in Deer
River, Pilot? Friday? All right.
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; home. See me through,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221; Having committed
themselves in this way, nothing can
save them from Higgins&#8211;neither their
own drunken will (if they escape him
for an interval) nor the antagonism
of the keepers of places. This is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
perilous and unscholarly work; systematic
theology has nothing to do
with escorting through a Minnesota
lumber-town a weak-kneed boy who
wants to take his money home to his
mother in Michigan.</p>

<p>Once the Pilot discovered such a
boy in the bar-room of a Bemidji
saloon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your money?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;N my pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand it over,&#8221; said the Pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are; and you&#8217;re going
to do it quick. Come out of this!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cowed by these large words, the
boy yielded to the grip of Higgins&#8217;s
big hand, and was led away a little.
Then the bartender leaned over the
bar. A gambler or two lounged toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
the group. There was a pregnant
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Higgins,&#8221; said the bartender,
&#8220;what business is this of
yours, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What business&#8211;of <i>mine?</i>&#8221; asked
the astounded Pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; what you buttin&#8217; in for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Higgins, &#8220;<i>is my
job!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The Pilot was leaning wrathfully
over the bar, his face thrust belligerently
forward, alert for whatever
might happen. The bartender struck
at him. Higgins had withdrawn.
The bartender came over the bar at
a bound. The preacher caught him
on the jaw in mid-air with a stiff
blow, and he fell headlong and unconscious.
They made friends next
day&#8211;the boy being then safely out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
of town. It is not hard for Higgins
to make friends with bartenders.
They seem to like it; Higgins really
does.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was in some saloon of the woods
that the watchful Higgins observed
an Irish lumber-jack empty his
pockets on the bar and, in a great
outburst of joy, order drinks for the
crowd. The men lined up; and the
Pilot, too, leaned over the bar, close
to the lumber-jack. The bartender
presently whisked a few coins from
the little heap of gold and silver.
Higgins edged nearer. In a moment,
as he knew&#8211;just as soon as the
lumber-jack would for an instant turn
his back&#8211;the rest of the money
would be deftly swept away.</p>

<p>The thing was about to happen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
when Higgins&#8217;s big hand shot out
and covered the heap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat,&#8221; said he, quietly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not
take a drink. This,&#8221; he added, as
he put the money in his pocket, &#8220;is
my treat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Pilot stood them all off&#8211;the
hangers on, the runners, the gamblers,
the bartender (with a gun), and
the Irish lumber-jack himself. To
the bartender he remarked (while he
gazed contemptuously into the muzzle
of the gun) that should ever the
fellow grow into the heavy-weight
class he would be glad to &#8220;take him
on.&#8221; As it was, he was really not
worth considering in any serious way,
and had better go get a reputation.
It was a pity&#8211;for the Pilot (said he)
was fit and able&#8211;but the thrashing
must be postponed for the time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>There was no shooting.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Further to illustrate the ease with
which the lumber-jack may be robbed,
I must relate that last midwinter,
in the office of a Deer River
hotel, the Pilot was greeted with
hilarious affection by a boy of twenty
or thereabouts who had a moment
before staggered out from the bar-room.
The youngster was having an
immensely good time, it seemed; he
was full of laughter and wit and song&#8211;not
yet quite full of liquor. It was
snowing outside, I recall, and a bitter
wind was blowing from the north;
but it was warm and light in the
office&#8211;bright, and cosy, and companionable:
very different, indeed,
from the low, stifling, crowded, ill-lit
bunk-houses of the camps, nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
was his elation like the weariness of
those places. There were six men
lying drunk on the office floor-in
grotesque attitudes, very drunk,
stretched out and snoring where they
had fallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy,&#8221; demanded the Pilot,
&#8220;where&#8217;s your money?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young lumber-jack said that
it was in the safe-keeping of the bartender.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much you got left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I got lots yet,&#8221; was the happy
reply.</p>

<p>Presently the boy went away, and
presently he reeled back again, and
put a hand on the Pilot&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Near all in?&#8221; asked the Pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here yesterday morning
with a hundred and twenty-three
dollars,&#8221; said the boy, very drunkenly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
&#8220;and I give it to the bartender to
keep for me, and I&#8217;m told I got two-thirty
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was quite content; but Higgins
knew that the money of which they
were robbing him was needed at his
home, a day&#8217;s journey to the east of
Deer River.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>There is no pleasure thereabout
(they say) but the spree, and the
end of the spree is the snake-room for
by far the most of the merry-makers&#8211;r
a penniless condition for all&#8211;pneumonia
for many&#8211;and for the survivors
a beggared, reeling return to
the hard work of the woods.</p>

<p>Higgins is used to picking over the
bodies of drunken men in the snake-room
heaps&#8211;of entering sadly, but
never reluctantly (he said), in search
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
of men who have been sorely wounded
in brawls, or are taken with pneumonia,
or in whom there remains
hope of regeneration. He carries
them off on his back to lodgings&#8211;or
he wheels them away in a barrow&#8211;and
he washes them and puts them
to bed and (sometimes angrily) restrains
them until their normal minds
return. It has never occurred to him,
probably, that this is an amazing exhibition
of primitive Christian feeling
and practice. He may have thought
of it, however, as a glorious opportunity
for service, for which he should
devoutly and humbly give thanks to
Almighty God.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span><a id='link_8'></a>VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>TOUCHING PITCH</span></h2>

<p>Not long ago Bemidji was what
the Pilot calls &#8220;the worst town
on the map.&#8221; It was indescribably
lawless and vicious. An adequate
description would be unprintable.
The government&#8211;the police and
magistrates&#8211;was wholly in the
hands of the saloon-keeping element.
It was a thoroughly noisome settlement.
The town authorities laughed
at the Pilot; the state authorities
gently listened to him and conveniently
forgot him, for political
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
reasons. But he was determined to
cleanse the place of its established
and flaunting wickednesses. He organized
a W. C. T. U.; and then&#8211;&#8220;Boys,&#8221;
said he to the keepers of
places, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to clean you out.
I want to be fair to you&#8211;and so I
tell you. Don&#8217;t you ever come sneaking
up to me and say I didn&#8217;t give
you warning!&#8221; They laughed at
him when he stripped off his coat
and got to work. In the bar-rooms
the toast was, &#8220;T&#8217; Higgins&#8211;and t&#8217;
hell with Higgins!&#8221; and down went
the red liquor. But when the fight
was over, when the shutters were up
for good&#8211;so had he compelled the
respect of these men&#8211;they came to
the preacher, saying: &#8220;Higgins, you
gave us a show; you fought us fair&#8211;and
we want to shake hands.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, boys,&#8221; said
Higgins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you shake hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll shake hands, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack Worth&#8211;that notorious gambler
and saloon-keeper of Bemidji&#8211;quietly
approached Higgins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frank,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you win; but
I&#8217;ve no hard feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Jack,&#8221; said
Higgins.</p>

<p>The Pilot remembered that he had
sat close to the death-bed of the
young motherless son of this same
Jack Worth in the room above the
saloon. They had been good friends&#8211;the
big Pilot and the boy. And
Jack Worth had loved the boy in
a way that only Higgins knew.
&#8220;Papa,&#8221; said the boy, at this time,
death being then very near, &#8220;I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
you to promise me something.&#8221; Jack
Worth listened. &#8220;I want you to
promise me, papa,&#8221; the boy went on,
&#8220;that you&#8217;ll never drink another drop
in all your life.&#8221; Jack Worth promised,
and kept his promise; and Jack
Worth and the preacher had preserved
a queer friendship since that
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; said the Pilot, now, &#8220;what
you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to quit this
dirty business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran a square game in my house,
and you know it,&#8221; the gambler replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Jack,&#8221; Higgins
said; &#8220;but look here, old man, isn&#8217;t
little Johnnie <i>ever</i> going to pull you
out of this?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>&#8220;Maybe, Frank,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>The gamblers, the bartenders, the
little pickpockets are as surely the
Pilot&#8217;s parishioners as anybody else,
and they like and respect him. Nobody
is excluded from his ministry.
I recall that Higgins was late one
night writing in his little room.
There came a knock on the door-a
loud, angry demand&#8211;a forewarning
of trouble, to one who knows
about knocks (as the Pilot says).
Higgins opened, of course, and discovered
a big bartender, new to the
town&#8211;a bigger man than he, and a
man with a fighting reputation. The
object of the quarrelsome visit was
perfectly plain: the preacher braced
himself for combat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>&#8220;You Higgins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Higgins is my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever say that if it came
to a row between the gamblers of this
town and the lumber-jacks that you&#8217;d
fight with the lumber-jacks?&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins looked the man over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; snarled the visitor, &#8220;how
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my friend,&#8221; replied the
Pilot, laying off his coat, &#8220;<i>I guess
you&#8217;re my man!</i>&#8221; and advanced with
guard up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no gambler,&#8221; the visitor
hastily explained. &#8220;I&#8217;m a bartender.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Higgins.
&#8220;You&#8217;re my man just the same. I
meant bartenders, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the bartender, &#8220;I just
come up to ask you a question.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>Higgins attended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are men made by conditions,&#8221;
the bartender propounded, &#8220;or do
conditions make men?&#8221;</p>

<p>There ensued the hottest kind of an
argument. It turned out that the
man was a Socialist&#8211;a propagandist
who had come to Deer River to sow
the seed (he said). I have forgotten
what the Pilot&#8217;s contention was; but,
at any rate, it dodged the general
issue and concerned itself with the
specific question of whether or not
conditions at Deer River made saloon-keepers
and gamblers and worse and
bartenders&#8211;the affirmative of which
he held to be an abominable opinion.
They carried the argument to the
bar-room, where, one on each side
of the dripping bar, they disputed
until daylight, Higgins at times loudly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
taunting his opponent with the assertion
that a bartender could do nothing
but shame Socialism in the community.
It ended in this amicable
agreement: that the bartender was
privileged to attempt the persuasion
of Higgins to Socialism, and that
Higgins was permitted to practise
upon the bartender without let or hindrance
with a view to his conversion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a drink?&#8221; said the bartender.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh&#8211;what!&#8221; exclaimed the Pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a little something soft?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take a glass of water
over your dirty bar,&#8221; Higgins is said
to have roared, &#8220;if I died of thirst!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man will not compromise.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>To all these men, as well as to the
lumber-jacks, the Pilot gives his help
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
and carries his message: to all the
loggers and lumber-jacks and road-monkeys
and cookees and punk-hunters
and wood-butchers and swamp-men
and teamsters and bull-cooks and
the what-nots of the woods, and the
gamblers and saloon-keepers and panderers
and bartenders (and a host of
filthy little runners and pullers-in and
small thieves) of the towns. He has
no abode near by, no church; he
preaches in bunk-houses, and sleeps
above saloons and in the little back
rooms of hotels and in stables and
wherever a blanket may be had in the
woods. He ministers to nobody else:
just to men like these. To women,
too: not to many, perhaps, but still
to those whom the pale men of the
towns find necessary to their gain.
To women like Nellie, in swiftly failing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
health, who could not escape (she
said) because she had lost the knack
of dressing in any other way. She
beckoned him, aboard train, well
aware of his profession; and when
Higgins had listened to her ordinary
little story, her threadbare, pathetic
little plea to be helped, he carried her
off to some saving Refuge for such as
she. To women like little Liz, too,
whose consumptive hand Higgins held
while she lay dying alone in her
tousled bed in the shuttered Fifth
Red House.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I dyin&#8217;, Pilot?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my girl,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dyin&#8217;&#8211;<i>now?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins said again that she was
dying; and little Liz was dreadfully
frightened then&#8211;and began to sob
for her mother with all her heart.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>I conceive with what tenderness the
big, kind, clean Higgins comforted
her&#8211;how that his big hand was soft
and warm enough to serve in that extremity.
It is not known to me, of
course; but I fancy that little Liz of the
Fifth Red House died more easily&#8211;more
hopefully&#8211;because of the proximity
of the Pilot&#8217;s clear, uplifted soul.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span><a id='link_9'></a>IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN SPITE OF LAUGHTER</span></h2>

<p>Higgins was born on August
19, 1865, in Toronto, Ontario,
the son of a hotel-keeper. When he
was seven years old his father died,
and two years later his mother remarried
and went pioneering to Shelburne,
Dufferin County, Ontario,
which was then a wilderness. There
was no school; consequently there
was no schooling. Higgins went
through the experience of conversion
when he was eighteen. Presently,
thereafter, he determined to be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
minister; and they laughed at him.
Everybody laughed. Obviously, what
he must have was education; but he
had no money, and (as they fancied)
less capacity. At any rate, the dogged
Higgins began to preach; he preached&#8211;and
right vigorously, too, no doubt&#8211;to
the stumps on his stepfather&#8217;s
farm; and he kept on preaching
until, one day, laughing faces slowly
rose from behind the stumps, whereupon
he took to his heels. At twenty
he started to school with little children
in Toronto. It was hard (he was
still a laughing-stock); and there
were three years of it&#8211;and two more
in the high school. Then off went
Higgins as a lay preacher of the
Methodist Episcopal Church to Annandale,
Minnesota. Following this
came two years at Hamline University.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
In 1895 he was appointed to
the charge of the little Presbyterian
church at Barnum, Minnesota, a
town of four hundred, where, subsequently,
he married Eva L. Lucas,
of Rockford, Minnesota.</p>

<p>It was here (says he) that the call
came.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span><a id='link_10'></a>X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VOICE OF THE LORD</span></h2>

<p>It was on the way between camps,
of a Sunday afternoon in midwinter,
when the Pilot related the
experience which led to the singular
ministerial activities in which he is
engaged. He was wrapped in a thick
Mackinaw coat, with a cloth cap
pulled down over his ears; and he
wore big overshoes, which buckled
near to his knees. There was a
heavy pack on his pack; it contained
a change of socks (for himself), and
many pounds of &#8220;readin&#8217; matter&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
(for &#8220;the boys&#8221;). He had preached
in the morning at one camp, in the
afternoon at another, and was now
bound to a third, where (as it turned
out) a hearty welcome was waiting.
The day&#8211;now drawn far toward
evening&#8211;was bitterly cold. There
was no wind. It was still and white
and frosty on the logging-road.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>It seems that once from Barnum
the Pilot went vacating into the woods
to see the log-drive.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a preacher,&#8221; said the boys.
&#8220;Give us a sermon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins preached that evening,
and the boys liked it. They liked
the sermon; they fancied their own
singing of <i>Rock of Ages</i> and <i>Jesus,
Lover of My Soul</i>. They asked Higgins
to come again. Frequently after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
that&#8211;and ever oftener&#8211;Higgins
walked into the woods when the drive
was on, or into the camps in winter,
to preach to the boys. They welcomed
him; they were always glad
to see him&#8211;and with great delight
they sang <i>Jesus, Lover of My Soul</i>
and <i>Throw Out the Life-Line</i>. Nobody
else preached to them in those
days; a great body of men&#8211;almost
a multitude in all those woods: the
Church had quite forgotten them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said Higgins, &#8220;you&#8217;ve always
treated me right, here. Come
in to see me when you&#8217;re in town.
The wife &#8217;ll be glad to have you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They took him at his word. Without
warning, one day, thirty lumber-jacks
crowded into the little parlor.
They were hospitably received.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilot,&#8221; said the spokesman, all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
now convinced of Higgins&#8217;s genuineness,
&#8220;here&#8217;s something for you from
the boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>A piece of paper (a check for fifty-one
dollars) was thrust into the
Pilot&#8217;s hand, and the whole crew
decamped on a run, with howls of
bashful laughter, like a pack of half-grown
school-boys. And so the relationship
was first established.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was in winter, Higgins says, that
the call came; and the voice of the
Lord, as he says, was clear in direction.
Two lumber-jacks came out
of the woods to fetch him to the bedside
of a sick homesteader who had
been at work in the lumber-camps.
The homesteader was a sick man
(said they), and he had asked for the
Pilot. The doctor was first to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
man&#8217;s mean home. There was no
help for him, said he, in a log-cabin
deep in the woods; if he could be
taken to the hospital in Duluth there
might be a chance. It was doubtful,
of course; but to remain was death.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Higgins. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
take him to the hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hospital doctor in Duluth said
that the man was dying. The Pilot
so informed the homesteader and bade
him prepare. But the man smiled.
He had already prepared. &#8220;I heard
you preach&#8211;that night&#8211;in camp&#8211;on
the river,&#8221; said he. It seems that
he had been reared in a Christian
home, but had not for twenty years
heard the voice of a minister in exhortation
until Higgins chanced that
way. And afterward&#8211;when the
lights in the wannigan were out and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
the crew had gone to sleep&#8211;he could
not banish the vision of his mother.
Life had been sweeter to him since
that night. The Pilot&#8217;s message (said
he) had saved him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Higgins,&#8221; said he, &#8220;go back
to the camp and tell the boys about
Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins wondered if the Lord had
spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to the camps,&#8221; the dying
man repeated, &#8220;and tell the boys
about Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody else was doing it. Why
shouldn&#8217;t Higgins? The boys had
no minister. Why shouldn&#8217;t Higgins
be that minister? Was not this the
very work the Lord had brought him
to this far place to do? Had not the
Lord spoken with the tongue of this
dying man? &#8220;Go back to the camps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
and tell the boys about Jesus.&#8221; The
phrase was written on his heart.
&#8220;Go back to the camp and tell the
boys about Jesus.&#8221; How it appealed
to the young preacher&#8211;the very form
of it! All that night, the homesteader
having died, Higgins&#8211;not then the
beloved Pilot&#8211;walked the hospital
corridor. When day broke he had
made up his mind. Whatever dreams
of a city pulpit he had cherished were
gone. He would go back to the
camps for good and all.</p>

<p>And back he went.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>We had now come over the logging-road
near to the third camp. The
story of the call was finished at sunset.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the Pilot, heartily,
with half a smile, &#8220;here I am, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>&#8220;On the job,&#8221; laughed one of the
company.</p>

<p>&#8220;For good and all,&#8221; Higgins agreed.
&#8220;It&#8217;s funny about life,&#8221; he added,
gravely. &#8220;I&#8217;m a great big wilful fellow,
naturally evil, I suppose; but it
seems to me that all my lifelong the
Lord has just led me by the hand as
if I were nothing but a little child.
And I didn&#8217;t know what was happening
to me! Now isn&#8217;t that funny?
Isn&#8217;t the whole thing funny?&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span><a id='link_11'></a>XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>FIST-PLAY</span></h2>

<p>It used sometimes to be difficult for
Higgins to get a hearing in the
camps; this was before he had fought
and preached his way completely into
the trust of the lumber-jacks. There
was always a warm welcome for him
in the bunk-houses, to be sure, and
for the most part a large eagerness
for the distraction of his discourses
after supper; but here and there in
the beginning he encountered an
obstreperous fellow (and does to this
day) who interrupted for the fun of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
the thing. It is related that upon
one occasion a big Frenchman began
to grind his axe of a Sunday evening
precisely as Higgins began to
preach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the boys here,&#8221; Higgins
drawled, &#8220;want to hear me preach,
and if the boys would just grind their
axes some other time I&#8217;d be much
obliged.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grinding continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; Higgins proceeded, his
voice rising a little, &#8220;that a good
many of the boys have asked me to
preach a little sermon to them; but
I can&#8217;t preach while one of the boys
grinds his axe.&#8221;</p>

<p>No impression was made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; Higgins went on,
&#8220;most of you want to hear me preach,
and <i>I&#8217;m going to preach</i>, all right;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
but I cant preach if anybody grinds
an axe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Frenchman whistled a tune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend, back there!&#8221; Higgins
called out, &#8220;can&#8217;t you oblige the
boys by grinding that axe another
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was some tittering in the
bunk-house&#8211;and the grinding went
on&#8211;and the tune came saucily up
from the door where the Frenchman
stood. Higgins walked slowly back;
having come near, he paused&#8211;then
put his hand on the Frenchman&#8217;s
shoulder in a way not easily misunderstood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend,&#8221; he began, softly, &#8220;if
you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Frenchman struck at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep back, boys!&#8221; an old Irishman
yelled, catching up a peavy-pole.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
&#8220;Give the Pilot a show! Keep out
o&#8217; this or I&#8217;ll brain ye!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Sky Pilot caught the Frenchman
about the waist&#8211;flung him
against a door&#8211;caught him again on
the rebound&#8211;put him head foremost
in a barrel of water&#8211;and absent-mindedly
held him there until the old
Irishman asked, softly, &#8220;Say, Pilot,
ye ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; t&#8217; <i>drown</i> him, are ye?&#8221;
It was all over in a flash: Higgins
is wisely no man for half-way measures
in an emergency; in a moment
the Frenchman lay cast, dripping and
gasping, on the floor, and the bunk-house
was in a tumult of jeering.
Then Higgins proceeded with the
sermon; and&#8211;strangely&#8211;he is of
an earnestness and frankly mild and
loving disposition so impressive that
this passionate incident had doubtless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
no destructive effect upon the solemn
service following. It is easy to fancy
him passing unruffled to the upturned
cask which served him for a pulpit,
readjusting the blanket which was
his altar-cloth, raising his dog-eared
little hymn-book to the smoky light
of the lantern overhead, and beginning,
feelingly: &#8220;Boys, let&#8217;s sing
Number Fifty-six: &#8216;<i>Jesus, lover of
my soul, let me to thy bosom fly.</i>&#8217;
You know the tune, boys; everybody
sing&#8211;&#8216;<i>While the nearer waters
roll and the tempest still is high.</i>&#8217;
All ready, now!&#8221; A fight in a church
would be a seriously disturbing commotion;
but a fight in a bunk-house&#8211;well, that is commonplace. There
is more interest in singing <i>Jesus,
Lover of My Soul</i>, than in dwelling
upon the affair afterward. And the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
boys sang heartily, I am sure, as they
always do, the Frenchman quite
forgotten.</p>

<p>Next day Higgins was roused by
the selfsame man; and he jumped
out of his bunk in a hurry (says he),
like a man called to fire or battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he thought, as he sighed,
&#8220;if I am ever to preach in these camps
again, I suppose, this man must be
satisfactorily thrashed; but&#8221;&#8211;more
cheerfully&#8211;&#8220;he needs a good thrashing,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilot,&#8221; said the Frenchman, &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry about last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins shook hands with him.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span><a id='link_12'></a>XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>MAKING THE GRADE</span></h2>

<p>Fully to describe Higgins&#8217;s altercations
with lumber-jacks and
tin-horn gamblers and the like in
pursuit of clean opportunity for other
men would be to pain him. It is a
phase of ministry he would conceal.
Perhaps he fears that unknowing folk
might mistake him for a quarrelsome
fellow. He is nothing of the sort,
however; he is a wise and efficient
minister of the gospel&#8211;but fights well,
upon good occasion, notwithstanding
his forty-odd years. In the Minnesota
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
woods fighting is as necessary as
praying&#8211;just as tender a profession
of Christ. Higgins regrets that he
knows little enough of boxing; he
shamefacedly feels that his preparation
for the ministry has in this respect
been inadequate. Once, when they
examined him before the Presbytery
for ordination, a new-made seminary
graduate from the East, rising, quizzed
thus: &#8220;Will the candidate not tell us
who was Cæsar of Rome when Paul
preached?&#8221; It stumped Higgins; but&#8211;he
told us on the road from Six to
Four&#8211;&#8220;I was confused, you see.
The only Cæsar I could think of was
Julius, and I knew that <i>that</i> wasn&#8217;t
right. If he&#8217;d only said <i>Emperor</i> of
Rome, I could have told him, of
<i>course!</i> Anyhow, it didn&#8217;t matter
much.&#8221; Boxing, according to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
experience of Higgins, was an imperative
preparation for preaching in
his field; a little haziness concerning
an Emperor of Rome really didn&#8217;t
matter so very much. At any rate,
the boys wouldn&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>Higgins&#8217;s ministry, however, knows
a gentler service than that which a
strong arm can accomplish in a bar-room.
When Alex McKenzie lay
dying in the hospital at Bemidji&#8211;a
screen around his cot in the ward&#8211;the
Pilot sat with him, as he sits with
all dying lumber-jacks. It was the
Pilot who told him that the end was
near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearing the landing, Pilot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost there, Alex.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a heavy load, Pilot&#8211;a heavy
load!&#8221;</p>

<p>McKenzie was a four-horse teamster,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
used to hauling logs from the
woods to the landing at the lake&#8211;forty
thousand pounds of new-cut
timber to be humored over the logging-roads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilot,&#8221; he asked, presently, &#8220;do
you think I can make the grade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With help, Alex.&#8221;</p>

<p>McKenzie said nothing for a moment.
Then he looked up. &#8220;You
mean,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I need another
team of leaders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great Leader, Alex.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what you mean,&#8221; said
McKenzie: &#8220;you mean that I need the
help of Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>No need to tell what Higgins said
then&#8211;what he repeated about repentance
and faith and the infinite love
of God and the power of Christ for
salvation. Alex McKenzie had heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
it all before&#8211;long before, being Scottish
born, and a Highlander&#8211;and had
not utterly forgotten, prodigal though
he was. It was all recalled to him,
now, by a man whose life and love and
uplifted heart were well known to
him&#8211;his minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray for me,&#8221; said he, like a
child.</p>

<p>McKenzie died that night. He had
said never a word in the long interval;
but just before his last breath was
drawn&#8211;while the Pilot still held his
hand and the Sister of Charity numbered
her beads near by&#8211;he whispered
in the Pilot&#8217;s ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell the boys I made the grade!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Pat, the old road-monkey&#8211;now
come to the end of a long career of
furious living&#8211;being about to die,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
sent for Higgins. He was desperately
anxious concerning the soul that
was about to depart from his ill-kept
and degraded body; and he was in
pain, and turning very weak.</p>

<p>Higgins waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilot,&#8221; Pat whispered, with a
knowing little wink, &#8220;I want you to
fix it for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To fix it, Pat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, you know what I mean,
Pilot,&#8221; Pat replied. &#8220;I want you to
fix it for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat,&#8221; said Higgins, &#8220;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> fix
it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the dying man, in
amazement, &#8220;what the hell did you
come here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To show you,&#8221; Higgins answered,
gently, &#8220;how <i>you</i> can fix it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Me</i> fix it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>Higgins explained, then, the scheme
of redemption, according to his creed&#8211;the
atonement and salvation by
faith. The man listened&#8211;and nodded
comprehendingly&#8211;and listened,
still with amazement&#8211;all the time
nodding his understanding. &#8220;Uh-<i>huh!</i>&#8221;
he muttered, when the preacher
had done, as one who says, I <i>see!</i>
He said no other word before he died.
Just, &#8220;Uh-<i>huh!</i>&#8221;&#8211;to express enlightenment.
And when, later, it came
time for him to die, he still held
tight to Higgins&#8217;s finger, muttering,
now and again, &#8220;Uh-<i>huh!</i> Uh-<i>huh!</i>&#8221;&#8211;like
a man to whom has come some
great astounding revelation.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a id='link_13'></a>XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>STRAIGHT FROM THE SHOULDER</span></h2>

<p>In the bunk-house, after supper,
Higgins preaches. It is a solemn
service: no minister of them all
so punctilious as Higgins in respect
to reverent conduct. The preacher
is in earnest and single of purpose.
The congregation is compelled to
reverence. &#8220;Boys,&#8221; says he, in cunning
appeal, &#8220;this bunk-house is our
church&#8211;the only church we&#8217;ve got.&#8221;
No need to say more! And a queer
church: a low, long hut, stifling and
ill-smelling and unclean and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
infested, a row of double-decker bunks
on either side, a great glowing stove
in the middle, socks and Mackinaws
steaming on the racks, boots put out
to dry, and all dim-lit with lanterns.
Half-clad, hairy men, and boys with
young beards, lounge everywhere&#8211;stretched
out on the benches, peering
from the shadows of the bunks,
squatted on the fire-wood, cross-legged
on the floor near the preacher.
Higgins rolls out a cask for a pulpit
and covers it with a blanket. Then
he takes off his coat and mops his
brow.</p>

<p>Presently, hymn-book or Testament
in hand, he is sitting on the pulpit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much light here,&#8221; says he,
&#8220;so I won&#8217;t read to-night; but I&#8217;ll
<i>say</i> the First Psalm. Are you all
ready?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>Everybody is ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. &#8216;<i>Blessed is the man
that walketh not in the counsel of the
ungodly,</i>&#8217; boys, &#8216;<i>nor standeth in the
way of sinners.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The door opens and a man awkwardly
enters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got any room back there for
Bill, boys?&#8221; the preacher calls.</p>

<p>There seems to be room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see you after service,
Bill. You&#8217;ll find a seat back there
with the boys. &#8216;<i>For the Lord knoweth
the way of the righteous; but the way
of the ungodly,</i>&#8217; gentlemen, &#8216;<i>shall
perish.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a prayer, restrained, in the
way of the preacher&#8217;s church&#8211;a petition
terrible with earnestness. One
wonders how a feeling God could
turn a deaf ear to the beseeching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
eloquence of it! And the boys sing&#8211;lustily,
too&#8211;led by the stentorian
preacher. An amazing incongruity:
these seared, blasphemous barbarians
bawling, <i>What a Friend I Have in
Jesus!</i></p>

<p>Enjoy it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilot,&#8221; said one of them, in open
meeting, once, with no irreverence
whatsoever, &#8220;that&#8217;s a damned fine
toon! Why the hell don&#8217;t they have
toons like that in the shows? Let&#8217;s
sing her again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said the preacher, not at
all shocked; &#8220;let&#8217;s sing her again!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a sermon&#8211;composed
on the forest roads from camp to
camp: for on those long, white,
cold, blustering roads Higgins either
whistles his blithe way (like a boy)
or fashions his preaching. It is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
searching, eloquent sermon: none
other so exactly suited to environment
and congregation&#8211;none other
so simple and appealing and comprehensible.
There isn&#8217;t a word of
cant in it; there isn&#8217;t a suggestion of
the familiar evangelistic rant. Higgins
has no time for cant (he says)&#8211;nor
any faith in ranting. The sermon
is all orthodox and significant
and reasonable; it has tender wisdom,
and it is sometimes terrible with
naked truth. The phrasing? It is
as homely and brutal as the language
of the woods. It has no affectation
of slang. The preacher&#8217;s message
is addressed with wondrous cunning
to men in their own tongue: wherefore
it could not be repeated before
a polite congregation. Were the
preacher to ejaculate an oath (which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
he never would do)&#8211;were he to exclaim,
&#8220;By God! boys, this is the
only way of salvation!&#8221;&#8211;the solemnity
of the occasion would not be disturbed
by a single ripple.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did the young man do?&#8221;
he asked, concerning the Prodigal;
&#8220;why, he packed his turkey and went
off to blow his stake&#8211;<i>just like you!</i>&#8221;
Afterward, when the poor Prodigal
was penniless: &#8220;What about him <i>then</i>,
boys? <i>You</i> know. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t need to
tell you. You learned all about it
at Deer River. It was the husks and
the hogs for him&#8211;<i>just like it is for
you!</i> It&#8217;s up the river for you&#8211;and
it&#8217;s back to the woods for you&#8211;when
they&#8217;ve cleaned you out at Deer
River!&#8221; Once he said, in a great
passion of pity: &#8220;Boys, you&#8217;re out
here, floundering to your waists,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
picking diamonds from the snow of these
forests, to glitter, not in pure places,
but on the necks of the saloon-keepers&#8217;
wives in Deer River!&#8221; There is applause
when the Pilot strikes home.
&#8220;That&#8217;s damned true!&#8221; they shout.
And there is many a tear shed (as I
saw) by the young men in the shadows
when, having spoken long and
graciously of home, he asks: &#8220;When
did you write to your mother last?
You, back there&#8211;and you! Ah,
boys, don&#8217;t forget her!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was pause while the preacher
leaned earnestly over the blanketed
barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Write home to-night,&#8221; he besought
them. &#8220;<i>She&#8217;s&#8211;waiting&#8211;for&#8211;that&#8211;letter!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>They listened.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a id='link_14'></a>XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT</span></h2>

<p>The Pilot is a fearless preacher&#8211;fearless
of blame and violence&#8211;and he is the most downright and
pugnacious of moral critics. He
speaks in mighty wrath against the
sins of the camps and the evil-doers of
the towns&#8211;naming the thieves and
gamblers by name and violently
characterizing their ways: until it
seems he must in the end be done to
death in revenge. &#8220;Boys,&#8221; said he,
in a bunk-house denunciation, &#8220;that
tin-horn gambler Jim Leach is back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
in Deer River from the West with a
crooked game&#8211;just laying for you.
I watched his game, boys, and I know
what I&#8217;m talking about; <i>and you know
I know!</i>&#8221; Proceeding: &#8220;You know
that saloon-keeper Tom Jenkins?
Of <i>course</i> you do! Well, boys, the
wife of Tom Jenkins nodded toward
the camps the other day, and, &#8216;Pshaw!&#8217;
says she; &#8216;what do I care about expense?
My husband has a thousand
men working for him in the woods!&#8217;
She meant you, boys! A thousand of
you&#8211;think of it!&#8211;working for the wife
of a brute like Tom Jenkins.&#8221; Again:
&#8220;Boys, I&#8217;m just out from Deer River.
I met ol&#8217; Bill Morgan yesterday.
&#8216;Hello, Bill!&#8217; says I; &#8216;how's business?&#8217;
&#8216;Slow, Pilot,&#8217; says he; &#8216;but I ain&#8217;t
worryin&#8217; none&#8211;it&#8217;ll pick up when the
boys come in with their stake in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
spring.&#8217; There you have it! That&#8217;s
what you&#8217;ll be up against, boys, God
help you! when you go in with your
stake&#8211;a gang of filthy thieves like
Jim Leach and Tom Jenkins and Bill
Morgan!&#8221; It takes courage to attack,
in this frank way, the parasites of a
lawless community, in which murder
may be accomplished in secret, and
perjury is as cheap as a glass of
whiskey.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>It takes courage, too, to denounce
the influential parishioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You grown-up men, here,&#8221; Higgins
complained to his congregation,
&#8220;ought to give the young fellows a
chance to live decent lives. Shame
to you that you don&#8217;t! You&#8217;ve lived
in filth and blasphemy and whiskey so
long that maybe you don&#8217;t know any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
better; but I want to tell you&#8211;every
one of you&#8211;that these boys don&#8217;t want
that sort of thing. They remember
their mothers and their sisters, and
they want what&#8217;s <i>clean!</i> Now, you
leave &#8217;em alone. Give &#8217;em a show
to be decent. And I&#8217;m talking to <i>you</i>,
Scotch Andrew&#8221;&#8211;with an angry
thump of the pulpit and a swift
belligerent advance&#8211;&#8220;and to <i>you</i>,
Gin Thompson, sneaking back there
in your bunk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hell!&#8221; said Gin Thompson.</p>

<p>The Pilot was instantly confronting
the lazy-lying man. &#8220;Gin,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll take that back!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gin laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Understand me?&#8221; the wrathful
preacher shouted.</p>

<p>Gin Thompson understood. Very
wisely&#8211;however unwillingly&#8211;he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
apologized. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Pilot,&#8221;
said he; &#8220;you know I didn&#8217;t mean
nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; the preacher muttered,
returning to his pulpit and his
sermon, &#8220;I&#8217;d rather preach than
fight.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Not by any means all Higgins&#8217;s
sermons are of this nature; most are
conventional enough, perhaps&#8211;but
always vigorous and serviceable&#8211;and
present the ancient Christian philosophy
in an appealing and deeply
reverent way. I recall, however, another
downright and courageous display
of dealing with the facts without
gloves. It was especially fearless because
the Pilot must have the permission
of the proprietors before he
may preach in the camps. It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
related that a drunken logger&#8211;the proprietor
of the camp&#8211;staggered into
Higgins&#8217;s service and sat down on the
barrel which served for the pulpit.
The preacher was discoursing on
the duties of the employed to the
employer. It tickled the drunken
logger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit &#8217;em again, Pilot!&#8221; he applauded.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll do &#8217;em good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins pointed out the wrong
worked the owners by the lumber-jacks&#8217;
common custom of &#8220;jumping
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em hell!&#8221; shouted the logger.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll do &#8217;em good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins proceeded calmly to discuss
the several evils of which the lumber-jacks
may be accused in relation to
their employers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Pilot,&#8221; the logger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
agreed, clapping the preacher on the
back. &#8220;Hit the <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span> rascals again!
It&#8217;ll do &#8217;em good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, boys,&#8221; Higgins continued,
gently, &#8220;we come to the other
side of the subject. You owe a lot
to your employers, and I&#8217;ve told you
frankly what your minister thinks
about it. But what can be expected
of you, anyhow? Who sets you a
good example of fair dealing and
decent living? Your employers?
Look about you and see! What kind
of an example do your employers set?
Is it any wonder,&#8221; he went on, in a
breathless silence, &#8220;that you go wrong?
Is it any wonder that you fail to consider
those who fail to consider you?
Is it any wonder that you are just
exactly what you are, when the
men to whom you ought to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
able to look for better things are
themselves filthy and drunken loafers?&#8221;</p>

<p>The logger was thunderstruck.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how d&#8217;ye like <i>that</i>, Mister
Woods?&#8221; the preacher shouted, turning
on the man, and shaking his fist
in his face. &#8220;How d&#8217;ye like <i>that</i>?
Does it do <i>you</i> any good?&#8221;</p>

<p>The logger wouldn&#8217;t tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us pray!&#8221; said the indignant
preacher.</p>

<p>Next morning the Pilot was summoned
to the office. &#8220;You think it
was rough on you, do you, Mr.
Woods?&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t tell
the boys a thing that they didn&#8217;t know
already. And what&#8217;s more,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell them a thing that
your own son doesn&#8217;t know. You
know just as well as I do what road
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
<i>he&#8217;s</i> travelling; and you know just as
well as I do what you are doing to help
that boy along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins continued to preach in
those camps.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>One inevitably wonders what would
happen if some minister of the cities
denounced from his pulpit in these
frank and indignantly righteous terms
the flagrant sinners and hypocrites of
his congregation. What polite catastrophe
would befall him?&#8211;suppose
he were convinced of the wisdom and
necessity of the denunciation and had
no family dependent upon him. The
outburst leaves Higgins established
in the hearts of his hearers; and it
leaves him utterly exhausted. He
mingles with the boys afterward; he
encourages and scolds them, he hears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
confession, he prays in some quiet
place in the snow with those whose
hearts he has touched, he confers
with men who have been seeking to
overcome themselves, he writes letters
for the illiterate, he visits the sick,
he renews old acquaintanceship, he
makes new friends, he yarns of the
&#8220;cut&#8221; and the &#8220;big timber&#8221; and the
&#8220;homesteading&#8221; of other places, and
he distributes the &#8220;readin&#8217; matter,&#8221;
consisting of old magazines and tracts
which he has carried into camp.</p>

<p>At last he quits the bunk-house,
worn out and discouraged and downcast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I failed to-night,&#8221; he said, once,
at the superintendent&#8217;s fire. &#8220;It was
awfully kind of the boys to listen to
me so patiently. Did you notice how
attentive they were? I tell you, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
boys are <i>good</i> to me! Maybe I was
a little rough on them to-night. But
somehow all this unnecessary and
terrible wickedness enrages me. And
nobody else much seems to care about
it. And I&#8217;m their minister. And I
yearn to have the souls of these boys
awakened. I&#8217;ve just <i>got</i> to stand up
and tell them the truth about themselves
and give them the same old
Message that I heard when I was a
boy. I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s kind of
queer about ministers of the gospel,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got two Creations
now, and three Genesises. But
take a minister. It wouldn&#8217;t matter
to me if a brother minister fell from
grace. I&#8217;d pick him out of the mud
and never think of it again. It
wouldn&#8217;t cost <i>me</i> much to forgive him.
I know that we&#8217;re all human and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
liable to sin. But when an ordained
minister gets up in his pulpit and
dodges his duty&#8211;when he gets up
and dodges the truth&#8211;why, bah!
<i>I&#8217;ve got no time for him!</i>&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span><a id='link_15'></a>XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>CAUSE AND EFFECT</span></h2>

<p>This sort of preaching&#8211;this genuine
and practical ministry consistently
and unremittingly carried
on for love of the men, and without
prospect of gain&#8211;wins respect and
loyal affection. The dogged and
courageous method will be sufficiently
illustrated in the tale of the Big
Scotchman of White Pine&#8211;to Higgins
almost a forgotten incident of
fourteen years&#8217; service. The Big
Scotchman was discovered drunk and
shivering with apprehension&#8211;he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
in the first stage of <i>delirium tremens</i>&#8211;in
a low saloon of White Pine, some
remote and God-forsaken settlement
off the railroad, into which the Pilot
had chanced on his rounds. The
man was a homesteader, living alone
in a log-cabin on his grant of land,
some miles from the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; thought the Pilot, quite
familiar with the situation, &#8220;first of
all I&#8217;ve got to get him home.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was only one way of accomplishing
this, and the Pilot employed
it; he carried the Big Scotchman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; thought the Pilot, &#8220;what
next?&#8221;</p>

<p>The next thing was to wrestle with
the Big Scotchman, upon whom the
&#8220;whiskey sickness&#8221; had by that time
fallen&#8211;to wrestle with him in the
lonely little cabin in the woods, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
to get him down, and to hold him
down. There was no congregation
to listen to the eloquent sermon which
the Pilot was engaged in preaching;
there was no choir, there was no report
in the newspapers. But the
sermon went on just the same. The
Pilot got the Big Scotchman down,
and kept him down, and at last got
him into his bunk. For two days
and nights he sat there ministering&#8211;hearing,
all the time, the ravings of a
horrible delirium. There was an interval
of relief then, and during this
the Pilot gathered up every shred of
the Big Scotchman&#8217;s clothing and
safely hid it. There was not a garment
left in the cabin to cover his
nakedness.</p>

<p>The Big Scotchman presently wanted
whiskey.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the Pilot; &#8220;you stay
right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Big Scotchman got up to dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to wear,&#8221; said the Pilot.</p>

<p>Then the fight was on again. It
was a long fight&#8211;merely a physical
thing in the beginning, but a fight of
another kind before the day was done.
And the Pilot won. When the Big
Scotchman got up from his knees he
took the Pilot&#8217;s hand and said that, by
God&#8217;s help, he would live better than
he had lived. Moreover, he was as
good as his word. Presently White
Pine knew him no more; but news of
his continuance in virtue not long ago
came down to the Pilot from the
north. It was what the Pilot calls a
real reformation <i>and</i> conversion. It
seems that there is a difference.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>We had gone the rounds of the
saloons in Deer River, and had returned
late at night to the hotel. The
Pilot was very busy&#8211;he is always
busy, from early morning until the
last sot drops unconscious to the bar-room
floor, when, often, the real day&#8217;s
work begins; he is one of the hardest
workers in any field of endeavor. And
he was now heart-sick because of
what he had seen that night; but he
was not idle&#8211;he was still shaking
hands with his parishioners in the
bar-room, still advising, still inspiring,
still scolding and beseeching, still
holding private conversations in the
corners, for all the world like a popular
and energetic politician on primary
day.</p>

<p>A curious individual approached
me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>&#8220;Friend of the Pilot&#8217;s?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a good man.&#8221;</p>

<p>I observed that the stranger was
timid and slow&#8211;a singular fellow,
with a lean face and nervous hands
and clear but most unsteady eyes.
He was like an old hulk repainted.</p>

<p>&#8220;He done me a lot of good,&#8221; he
added, in a slow, soft drawl, hardly
above a whisper, at the same time
slowly smoothing his chin.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant thing to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;They used to call me Brandy
Bill,&#8221; he continued. He pointed to a
group of drunkards lying on the floor.
&#8220;I used to be like that,&#8221; said he, looking
up like a child who perceives that
he is interesting. After a pause, he
went on: &#8220;But once when the snakes
broke out on me I made up my mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
to quit. And then I went to the Pilot
and he stayed with me for a while,
and told me I had to hang on. I
thought I could do it if the boys would
leave me alone. So the Pilot told me
what to do. &#8216;Whenever you come
into town,&#8217; says he, &#8216;you go on to your
sister&#8217;s and borrow her little girl.&#8217;
Her little girl was just four years old
then. &#8216;And,&#8217; says the Pilot, &#8216;don&#8217;t
you never come down street without
her.&#8217; Well, I done what the Pilot
said. I never come down street
without that little girl hanging on to
my hand; and when she was with me
not one of the boys ever asked me to
take a drink. Yes,&#8221; he drawled,
glancing at the drunkards again, &#8220;I
used to be like that. Pretty near
time,&#8221; he added, like a man displaying
an experienced knowledge,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
&#8220;to put them fellows in the snake-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a ministry as the Pilot&#8217;s springs
from a heart of kindness&#8211;from a
pure and understanding love of all
mankind. &#8220;Boys,&#8221; said he, once, in
the superintendent&#8217;s office, after the
sermon in the bunk-house, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never
forget a porterhouse steak I saw once.
It was in Duluth. I&#8217;d been too busy
to have my breakfast, and I was
hungry. I&#8217;m a big man, you know,
and when I get hungry I&#8217;m <i>hungry</i>.
Anyhow, I wasn&#8217;t thinking about that
when I saw the steak. It didn&#8217;t
occur to me that I was hungry until I
happened to glance into a restaurant
window as I walked along. And
there I saw the steak. You know how
they fix those windows up: a chunk of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
ice and some lettuce and a steak or
two and some chops. Well, boys,
all at once I got so hungry that I
ached. I could hardly wait to get in
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Look here, Higgins,&#8217; thought I,
&#8216;what if you didn&#8217;t have a cent in your
pocket?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that was a puzzler.
&#8216;What if you were a dead-broke
lumber-jack, and hungry like this?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, it frightened me. I understood
just what those poor fellows
suffer. And I couldn&#8217;t go in the
restaurant until I had got square with
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Look here, Higgins,&#8217; I thought,
&#8216;the best thing you can do is to go
and find a hungry lumber-jack somewhere
and feed him.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>&#8220;And I did, too; and I tell you,
boys, I enjoyed my dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a ministry that wins good
friends, and often in unexpected
places: friends like the lumber-jack
(once an enemy) who would clear a
way for the Pilot in town, shouting,
&#8220;I&#8217;m road-monkeying for the Pilot!&#8221;
and friends like the Blacksmith.</p>

<p>Higgins came one night to a new
camp where an irascible boss was
in complete command.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t mind, will you,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;if I hold a little service for the
boys in the bunk-house to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boss ordered him to clear out.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I want to do,&#8221; Higgins protested,
mildly, &#8220;is just to hold a
little service for the boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the boss ordered him to
clear out: but Higgins had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
prepared with the authority of the proprietor
of the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a pass in my pocket,&#8221; he
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said the boss;
&#8220;you couldn&#8217;t preach in this camp if
you had a pass from God Almighty!&#8221;</p>

<p>To thrash or not to thrash? that
was the Pilot&#8217;s problem; and he determined
not to thrash, for he knew
very well that if he thrashed the boss
the lumber-jacks would lose respect
for the boss and jump the camp.
The Blacksmith, however, had heard&#8211;and
had heard much more than is
here written. Next morning he involved
himself in a quarrel with the
boss; and having thrashed him soundly,
and having thrown him into a
snowbank, he departed, but returned,
and, addressing himself to that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
portion of the foreman which protruded
from the snow, kicked it heartily,
saying: &#8220;There&#8217;s one for the Pilot.
And there&#8217;s another&#8211;and another.
I&#8217;ll learn you to talk to the Pilot like
a drunken lumber-jack. There&#8217;s another
for <i>him</i>. Take that&#8211;and that&#8211;for the Pilot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Subsequently Higgins preached in
those camps.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span><a id='link_16'></a>XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WAGES OF SACRIFICE</span></h2>

<p>One asks, Why does Higgins do
these things? The answer is
simple: Because he loves his neighbor
as himself&#8211;because he actually
<i>does</i>, without self-seeking or any
pious pretence. One asks, What
does he get out of it? I do not know
what Higgins gets. If you were to
ask him, he would say, innocently,
that once, when he preached at Camp
Seven of the Green River Works, the
boys fell in love with the singing.
<i>Jesus, Lover of My Soul</i>, was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
hymn that engaged them. They sang
it again and again; and when they
got up in the morning, they said:
&#8220;Say, Pilot, let&#8217;s sing her once more!&#8221;
They sang it once more&#8211;in the bunk-house
at dawn&#8211;and the boss opened
the door and was much too amazed
to interrupt. They sang it again.
&#8220;All out!&#8221; cried the boss; and the
boys went slowly off to labor in the
woods, singing, <i>Let me to Thy bosom
fly!</i> and, <i>Oh, receive my soul at last!</i>&#8211;diverging
here and there, axes and
saws over shoulder, some to the deeper
forest, some making out upon the
frozen lake, some pursuing the white
roads&#8211;all passing into the snow and
green and great trees and silence of
the undefiled forest which the Pilot
loves&#8211;all singing as they went, <i>Other
refuge have I none; hangs my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
helpless soul on Thee</i>&#8211;until the voices
were like sweet and soft-coming
echoes from the wilderness.</p>

<p>Poor Higgins put his face to the
bunk-house door and wept.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, boys,&#8221; he told us, on
the road from Six to Four, &#8220;it was
<i>pay</i> for what I&#8217;ve tried to do for the
boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later&#8211;when the Sky Pilot sat
with his stockinged feet extended to
a red fire in the superintendent&#8217;s log-cabin
of that bitterly cold night&#8211;he
betrayed himself to the uttermost.
&#8220;Do you know, boys,&#8221; said he, addressing
us, the talk having been of
the wide world and travel therein,
&#8220;I believe you fellows would spend
a dollar for a dinner and never think
twice about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>We laughed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>&#8220;If I spent more than twenty-five
cents,&#8221; said he, accusingly, &#8220;I&#8217;d have
indigestion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again we laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I spent fifty cents for a
hotel bed,&#8221; said he, with a grin, &#8220;I&#8217;d
have the nightmare.&#8221;</p>

<p>That is exactly what Higgins gets
out of it.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Higgins gets more than that out of
it: he gets a clean eye and sound
sleep and a living interest in life. He
gets even more: he gets the trust and
affection of almost&#8211;almost&#8211;every
lumber-jack in the Minnesota woods.
He wanders over two hundred square
miles of forest, and hardly a man of
the woods but would fight for his
Christian reputation at a word. For
example, he had pulled Whitey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
Mooney out of the filth and nervous
strain of the snake-room, and reestablished
him, had paid his board,
had got him a job in a near-by town,
had paid his fare, had taken him to
his place; but Whitey Mooney had
presently thrown up his job (being a
lazy fellow), and had fallen into the
depths again, had asked Higgins for
a quarter of a dollar for a drink or
two, and had been denied. Immediately
he took to the woods; and
in the camp he came to be complained
that Higgins had &#8220;turned him
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar,&#8221; they told him.
&#8220;The Pilot never turned a lumber-jack
down. Wait till he comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pilot,&#8221; said a solemn jack, rising,
when the sermon was over, as he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
been delegated, &#8220;do you know
Mooney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whitey Mooney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Do you know Whitey
Mooney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I do, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Did&#8211;you&#8211;turn&#8211;him&#8211;down?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I did, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Why?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgins informed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out o&#8217; there, Whitey!&#8221; they
yelled; and they took Whitey Mooney
from his bunk, and tossed him in a
blanket, and drove him out of camp.</p>

<p>Higgins is doing a hard thing&#8211;correcting
and persuading such men as
these; and he could do infinitely better
if he had more money to serve his
ends. They are not all drunkards and
savage beasts, of course. It would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
wrong them to say so. Many are self-respecting,
clean-lived, intelligent,
sober; many have wives and children,
to whom they return with clean hands
and mouths when the winter is over.
They all&#8211;without any large exception
(and this includes the saloon-keepers
and gamblers of the towns)&#8211;respect
the Pilot. It is related of him that
he was once taken sick in the woods.
It was a case of exposure&#8211;occurring
in cold weather after months of bitter
toil, with a pack on his back and in
deep trouble of spirit. There was a
storm of snow blowing, at far below
zero, and Higgins was miles from
any camp. He managed, however,
after hours of plodding through the
snow, to reach the uncut timber,
where he was somewhat sheltered
from the wind. He remembers that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
he was then intent upon the sermon
for the evening; but beyond&#8211;even
trudging through these tempered
places&#8211;he has forgotten what occurred.
The lumber-jacks found him
at last, lying in the snow near the
cook-house; and they carried him to
the bunk-house, and put him to bed,
and consulted concerning him. &#8220;The
Pilot&#8217;s an almighty sick man,&#8221; said
one. Another prescribed: &#8220;Got any
whiskey in camp?&#8221; There was no
whiskey&#8211;there was no doctor within
reach&#8211;there was no medicine of any
sort. And the Pilot, whom they had
taken from the snow, was a very sick
man. They wondered what could
be done for him. It seemed that nobody
knew. There was nothing to
be done&#8211;nothing but keep him covered
up and warm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; a lumber-jack proposed,
&#8220;how&#8217;s this for an idea?&#8221;</p>

<p>They listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can pray for the man,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;who&#8217;s always praying for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>They managed to do it somehow;
and when Higgins heard that the boys
were praying for him&#8211;<i>praying</i> for
him!&#8211;he turned his face to the wall,
and covered up his head, and wept
like a fevered boy.</p>

<p class='c mt20'>THE END</p>
